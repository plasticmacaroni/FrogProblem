# FrogProblem
This is a demonstration of the frog problem, which you can check out on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpwSGsb-rTs).
This program creates groups of two frogs, and then calculates the odds of one of the frogs being female.

This shows that 66% of the time (2/3), there is a female in the group. 

It's important to note that we don't know *which* of the frogs croaked. If we did know which frog croaked, the odds would be closer to 50%.

I didn't believe this myself, hence writing the program to hopefully demonstrate things objectively.
